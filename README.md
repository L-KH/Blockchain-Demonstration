# FAQ

### When or why I would use this?

You should use this if you want to understand altcoins wallet, payment processor, or bitcoin merchant portal in javascript. You might also be interested in why decentralized networks or p2p applications are useful, or what advantages they have; this project seems like a good way to learn about that.


### What is smallest definition of the blockchain ?

Blockchain is a distributed, decentralized, public ledger.


### What is the block chain actually for?

blockchain is only for "storing" the transaction history and "chain" or link them together using cryptography and in coins such as bitcoin by doing "work" hence the term proof of work. so blockchain only works as the public immutable ledger that only grows. the "authorization" happens by the user when they provide a digital signature.


### Why the hell should I care about the blockchain?

Blockchain facilitates trade over a network. Imagine a metal as scarce as gold with a magical property of "can be transported over a communications channel". This has implications with respect to individual rights, the world economy, and the way we monetize and transfer value at a level higher than bartering directly for goods.
